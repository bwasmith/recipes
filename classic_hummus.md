# Classic Hummus
Recipe initially from Hollis Potts

## Overview
Hummus by boiling veggies with the chickpeas. Prepare hummus with tahini garlic lemon. Add toppings as desired

## Ingredients
- Dried Chickpeas, 1 cup
- Onion, whole yellow or white
- Carrots, 2 medium (more to sweeten)
- Garlic, 6 cloves
- Lemon, 1 large or two small. ~3-4 tbs juice
- Tahini, 2-3 heaping tbs
- Salt, 2 tbs
- Baking Soda, 1 tbs

## Equipment
- Food processor or blender

## Chickpea Prep
- Chickpeas, 1 cup
- Onion, 1 chopped in half + skinned
- Carrot, 2 chopped in half
- Garlic, 5 cloves
- Baking Soda, 1 tbs
- Salt,       2 tbs

Let the Chickpeas soak overnight. One tbs ```Baking Soda```, one tbs ```Salt```  

Next day, prep ```Onion```, ```Garlic```(all but one clove), and ```Carrot```  
Drain/Wash chickpeas. Remove any malformed chickpeas.  
Add chickpeas to stock pot, cover with ~4 inches water. Add ```Onion```, ```Garlic```, ```Carrot```, one tbs ```Salt```  
Bring to a simmer. Simmer about 90 minutes, until soft. This depends on how long chickpeas were soaked. Should be able to mash somewhat easily between two fingers.  
If using blender, softer is better.  

Allow to cool in the broth. At least cool enough to handle comfortably.  

## Hummus Prep
- Previous stockpot
- Garlic, one clove
- Lemon juice
- Tahini

Remove vegetables. Bin 'em.  
Keep ~1 cup of stock while draining chickpeas.  

_Optional_: Secret to really creamy hummus is removing the peel of each chickpea. Chickpeas from Fans will have softer peels, may not need to be removed.
This step takes a little while (10-15 min), but leads to ridiculously creamy hummus.  

Add drained chickpeas, 1/4 cup stock, and garlic lemon tahini to food processor or blender.  
Blend until smooth. Taste, add more tahini or lemon juice as necessary.  
May be warm/soupy/runny. Will thicken in the fridge.  

## Toppings?
Pine nuts, parsley  

Dash of paprika  

Bit of olive oil
