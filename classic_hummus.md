# Classic Hummus
Recipe initially from Hollis Potts

## Overview
Hummus by boiling veggies with the chickpeas. Add seasoning

## Ingredients
- Dried Chickpeas, 1 Cup
- Onion, whole yellow or white
- Carrots, 2 medium (more to sweeten)
- Garlic, 6 cloves
- Lemon, 1 large or two small. ~3 tbs juice
- Tahini, 2 heaping tbs
- Salt, plenty
- Baking Soda

## Equipment
- Food processor or blender

## Chickpea Prep
- Chickpeas
- Onion, chopped in half + skinned
- Carrot, 2 chopped in half
- Garlic 5 Cloves
- Baking Soda, 1 tbs

Let the Chickpeas soak overnight. One tbs ```Baking Soda```, one tbs ```salt```  

Next day, prep ```onion```, ```garlic```(all but one clove), and ```carrot```  
Drain/Wash chickpeas.  
Add chickpeas to stock pot, cover with ~4 inches water. Add ```onion```, ```garlic```, ```carrot```  
Bring to a simmer, simmer about 3-5 hours until soft  
If using blender, softer is better  

## Hummus Prep
- Previous stockpot
- Garlic, one clove
- Lemon juice
- Tahini

Probably wait for stockpot to not be hot

Using tongs, remove vegetables. Bin 'em  
Keep ~2 cups of stock while draining chickpeas  

Add drained chickpeas and other ingredients to food processor.

Whoop, there it is

If warm, will be soupy/runny. Will thicken in the fridge.

## Toppings?
Pine nuts, parsley

Dash of paprika

Bit of olive oil

## Questions?
- Why Baking Soda for the overnight?
- The original ratio for garlic/Lemon to chickpeas I found is off. Maybe 2 cups of chickpeas?
- After a simmer for 3 hours, chickpeas were soft enough to mash easily between two fingers. Original Recipe states 5+ hours?
